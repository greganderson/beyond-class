# Creative

- [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/)
    - Mainly using JS and a JS library called p5.js
    - Some different topics such as fractals, Conway's Game of Life,
    particle & physics systems, and some procedural generation algorithms

- [Discover Three.js](https://discoverthreejs.com/)
    - A JS library for 3D models and animations in-browser

- [GSAP](https://gsap.com/)
    - A JS animation library usable in plain HTML + JS or with React

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
    - An open source game engine with a scripting language very similar to Python

# Grahpics

- [WebGL](https://webglfundamentals.org/)
    - A high-performance, low-level graphics library for browsers
    - Three.js actually uses WebGL under the hood

- [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/)
    - A cross-platform library for desktop applications
    - Most commonly used with C/C++, but has bindings for
    other languages such as Python and JavaScript

- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)
    - Another cross-platform library for desktop applications
    - Mostly used with C++, but has bindings for Python (PyQt)

- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
    - A Python library for desktop applications
    - It's a little older and not as flexible as PyQt

- [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/)
    - A Python library for developing TUI apps (graphical apps that run in the terminal)

# Algorithms

- [Generating Books from Battle for Esturia](https://esturiagames.wordpress.com/2022/03/10/generating-books/)
    - A blog post written by an indie game studio about how they generated
    the books found in the game
    - Nice introduction/example to Markov chains, sort of a super simplified
    version of LLMs

- [Wavefunction Collapse Algorithm](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/)
    - This is a good explanation of how the wavefunction collapse algorithm
    works, along with a simple implementation in Python

# React

- [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction)
    - A React library for Three.js

- [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/)
    - A UI component library for React

# Technologies

- [Websockets](https://blog.logrocket.com/websocket-tutorial-socket-io/)
    - A real-time communication protocol
    - What Web BBQ uses for updates and messages
    - The linked tutorial might be a little different from what we do in class
    (they use a Node.js server while we'll be making one with Python), but the
    websocket concepts are the main important thing

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
    - Build cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript
    - Bundles chromium engine so it's a little bit of a resource hog
    - Discord, Figma, Slack, 1Password, Obsidian, and VSCode are all built with Electron

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
    - Build mobile applications with React

# Languages

- C/C++
    - Classic languages
    - Will force you to become familiar with how memory works
		- [learncpp](learncpp.com) Online guide

- Rust
    - Similar to C++, but more memory safe

- Go
    - Syntax looks a little like Python
    - Very good for microservices or web servers
    - Used at TCN and Vasion here in St. George
		- [learn go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) Learn how to write tests 

# Topics/Other Things

- Procedural generation
    - Perlin noise
    - Wavefunction collapse
    - Markov chain
- State machines
- Open source contribution
    - It's really fun to be able to look at something you use and be able to say
    "Hey I added that!"
    - Taking on bug fixes for open source projects can also be a really good way to
    get used to familiarizing yourself with an existing codebase -- in the industry
    you'll most likely be given existing projects and not as much starting from scratch
- Browser extensions
    - Build an extension for the browser you use
    - It could be anything
- Vue
    - A frontend JS library similar to React
    - It's a little newer than React, so the ecosystem isn't as strong as React's
    - Has some interesting features React doesn't have, like events
